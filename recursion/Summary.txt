                   Recursion 

Input automatically becomes smaller in recursive problems as a consequence of our actions
Decisions taken result in input becoming smaller

Identifying recusive problems
1) Choices given in the problem
2) Decisions to be taken on the basis of the choices

Eg: Find all subsets of "abc"
Ans: Including a,b,c or not is a choice
Decisions taken on each choice lead to each subset
Decisions taken on including or not including each charecter reduces size of ip

Recursive tree
Representing decisions taken on input
 
Making recursive tree (ip-op method)

Initialize output

                               op ip
                            /        \
                op1 smaller ip           ip2 smaller ip
            /              \
    op1 smaller ip      op2 smaller ip  ...          ......


eg: input = "ab"

                       op" " | ip "ab" 
                    /                   \
                " " | "b"               "a" | "b"  Decision on a
                /                          \  
        " " | " "     "b" | " "       "a" | " "      "ab" | " "  Decision on b
            
In the last step all inputs are empty
All outputs represent all possible subsets
Leaf nodes represent answers

Solving recursive problems :
1) Design recursive tree
2) Code with reference to the tree
